**What made me choose 'TypeSmart'?**

TypeSmart focuses on the typographic choices of big technology brands and how they continue to stay up-to-date with modern generations and the new-age media. 'Type' demonstrates the exploration of typography whilst 'Smart' focuses on the technological emphasis. The smart also connotates the chosen brand’s ability to remain modern throughout the unpredictable changes.

**What Inspired the logo?**

When illustrating my brand, I pictured it to be a very modern, sleek design. This is because I wanted to emphasise my focus on the new generation. I believe my logo has captured this view whilst remaining simple yet effective. I originally started with just the ‘TS’ then recognised I wanted to illustrate the technological link. Therefore I added the smart phone silohette in the background as it is an ingenuous way of communicating the link of my blog to tech.
