#### **What’s the first thing that springs to mind when you think ‘high tech’ - is it the latest apple iPhone, your favourite computer, or an OLED TV?**

##### Now what springs to mind when you associate ‘high tech’ with a font? Technically you can’t physically have a high-tech font; however, the association between high tech and typography naturally creates a modern, futuristic design in your mind.

##### When you google high tech font, you are presented with many different typefaces, all containing many similarities. The main one being a sans serif typeface. Whilst serifs are usually considered old fashioned - sans serif fonts are a look to the future. As apple, Microsoft, Windows, and many other top name brands continue to align with the ever-changing world, they all currently hold a sans serif typeface - depicting the modernness of the product/design.

##### Not only do these fonts have no serifs, but they also have another peculiar similarity, many often neglect parts of each letter. Not only is the type smoothed, but by creating gaps in the type, it instantly causes viewers to believe it is futuristic. Despite this, it does not affect the legibility and if anything, makes it easier to read. This latest creation could be due to the inability in the past to create typefaces with specialist computers. Fonts can now include straight lines and are not restricted to handwritten, cursive styles. 

##### Below is an experiment; using the website ‘Fontspace’ which includes many different, obscure designs; There is a section labelled ‘high-tech fonts’.
