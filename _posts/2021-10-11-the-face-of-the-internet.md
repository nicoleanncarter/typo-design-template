Being a multinational technology company – Google, like Apple, has always managed to stay on top of the everchanging world of technological development. 

 

From 1997 – 1998 the original Google logo appeared to be a heavily distorted Arial Black with a range of colours. 

 

This was then changed to the beginning of the no longer distorted ITC New Baskerville Bold font choice. This was shadowed to create a 3D effect which was the first of its kind back in 1998 and noticed to be a new revelation of font design.

In 1999 the G was changed to blue which then set in stone the familiar colour scheme with a now even more prevalent soft wide shadow to the right. They continued with Baskerville Bold and made the popular shadowed effect more noticeable and modern. 

The Google logo as used from 1998 to 2015 was designed by Ruth Kedar. In [an article from 2008](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-14-n16.html), she comments on the design process, including the type choice:

> "Times Roman was the font of choice for the web at that time, while sans-serif fonts were the darling of the printed world. I wanted the readability of a serifed font, but looked for a typeface that had the same qualities we were looking for – subtly sophisticated, but with some humor and irreverence. The chosen typeface is based on **[Catull](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7582/catull)**, an old style serif typeface. Catull borrows elements from traditional writing instruments such as the quill and the chisel with a modern twist. Search, by nature, is an activity that requires we look into the past. Therefore Catull’s historical ties seemed appropriate, as did the bridging between the old analog world and the new emerging digital era.”
